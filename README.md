# OpenMirage
OpenMirage is a React application designed for visualisation of data from APIs and more. It's a modular system designed for developers to get a high level overview of what they're working on, so they're not constantly flicking between different terminals and windows.

**Due to the bare metal nature of OpenMirage, it's not recommended this is hosted in a way which makes it accessible for anyone else.** Treat it like you would a local testing database.
